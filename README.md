### Explanation
- I choose *Avengers: Infinity War* because it's my favorite superhero movie of all time, and the scene where heroes die is profoundly impactful and memorable.
In the main assignment, I intend to modify *Saint-Georges-Majeur au cr√©puscule."* In the original painting, the image is split into two parts by water, and I aim to replace the water's reflection with a fragmented effect, inspired by the disintegration scene.
- This effect conveys a sense of chaos and transformation. Incorporating this effect will add a dynamic and modern twist to the painting, making it visually engaging and thought-provoking.
